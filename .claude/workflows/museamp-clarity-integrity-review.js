const COMMON_RULES = `
GROUND RULES (apply to every reviewer):
- Repo root: ${ROOT}. You are READ-ONLY: never modify, create, or delete any file.
- FIRST read ${ROOT}/AGENTS.md — it defines mandatory local conventions. Per the code-clarity principle "Repository Conventions", a pattern explicitly mandated there is NOT a finding (e.g. closure-based RuntimeDependencies, FileManager.default direct use, Interface animation wrappers, 200pt hardcoded spacers, @unchecked Sendable + nonisolated fixes, hardcoded split patterns).
- Findings must cite a real file path relative to repo root and a line number. An adversarial verifier WILL open the file and try to refute you — vague or unverifiable findings get killed.
- Do not report: formatter-territory style (indentation, wrapping), test-file-only nitpicks, or anything whose fix would violate AGENTS.md.
- Your final output goes through the StructuredOutput tool only; it is data for a machine, not prose for a human.`

function clarityChecklist() {
  return `THE 13 CODE-CLARITY PRINCIPLES (full text at ${SKILL} — read it if you need detail):
1. Naming — names reveal intent: verbs for actions, noun-phrases for values, is/has/can/should booleans, no vague Manager/Helper/Util/handle()/process(), parameters labeled meaningfully.
2. Early return — guard-first, happy path at leftmost indentation, no else-after-return, invert nesting.
3. Function design — one thing per function, no "and" functions, no boolean behavior flags, 0-2 params preferred, side effects named.
4. State modeling — related flags/optionals describing one lifecycle = hidden state machine; prefer one enum/state value; no stored one-shot Tasks; no optional-as-state.
5. Abstraction levels — no mixing orchestration with raw bit/string manipulation in one scope; step-down rule.
6. Repository conventions — clarity is local; match the repo's split/naming/control-flow habits (AGENTS.md is authoritative here).
7. Error boundaries — scoped do/catch, no casual try? for lifecycle/user-visible failures, best-effort failures still leave a log trace (AGENTS.md REQUIRES AppLog/DBLog on every swallowed error — flag silent catch/try? without logging).
8. Class/struct design — single responsibility, honest names, struct for values, no accumulation types.
9. File organization — one primary type per file, Type+Feature.swift extensions, filename = export, no grab-bag files.
10. Named constants — magic numbers/strings hoisted to named private constants at the right scope; repeated literals centralized.
11. Mechanical consistency — defer to the formatter; flag only hand-fought formatting that diverges from repo style.
12. (Electron boundaries — N/A for this codebase; skip.)
13. Dependencies & seams — one canonical implementation per behavior (flag duplicated inline logic across call sites), seams only where behavior varies, no speculative protocols, no closure-injected dependency bags EXCEPT the AGENTS.md-sanctioned RuntimeDependencies.`
